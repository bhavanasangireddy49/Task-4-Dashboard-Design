# Task-4-Dashboard-Design
For the Task 4 Dashboard Design I used powerBI for the effective visualization
I analyzed the Super_store_sales.csv dataset and designed a Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics, including sales trends, product performance, regional analysis, and the relationship between discounts and profits. We used visualizations such as line charts, bar/column charts, combo charts, a map, and a scatter plot. Key features like slicers for interactivity, DAX measures for calculations, and a consistent color scheme were implemented to enhance clarity and usability. The final output summarizing the dashboard design, key insights, and recommendations for stakeholders.
